# TankLords
TBS tanks if Valkyria Chronicles and Warthunder had a baby.

Really old unity project, probably the two highlights are the pathfinding system which uses a turn radius and thickness to determine it's pathing.  Second is the penetration & camera mode.  It's a mix of WarThunder and World of Tanks with a penetration vs armor test that then determines how far the shell will go, and what it hits internally in each tank.  I use several different shaders and a timescale to achieve the effect.

I didn't get much beyond the basics, but it had potential.


Here's a gif of a tank getting hit and penetrated, with the swap to the internals view and highlighting damage:
